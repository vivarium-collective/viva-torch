"""Back-compat shim: ``pbg_torch`` was renamed to ``viva_torch``.

The import package was renamed as part of the pbg -> viva rebrand. This shim keeps
every existing consumer working during the deprecation window (Phase 1 of the
rename):

  * ``import pbg_torch`` / ``from pbg_torch import X`` works
    (re-exports the new package's top-level ``__all__``);
  * ``import pbg_torch.<sub>`` transparently resolves to
    ``viva_torch.<sub>`` via a meta-path finder; and
  * ``python -m pbg_torch.<sub>`` still executes (``get_code`` forwards the
    real module's code object to ``runpy``).

Importing anything under this package emits a one-time
:class:`DeprecationWarning`. Update imports to ``viva_torch``; this shim is
removed in a future major release. (The distribution is still named
``pbg-torch`` for now — that changes once consumers update their dependency
string.)
